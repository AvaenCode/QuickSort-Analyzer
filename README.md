# QuickSort Analyzer

A C++ project that analyzes the results of the Quick Sort algorithm and displays its run times in the console. The Quick Sort algorithim is ran on 3 different sets of integers:

- Array of size 'n' in ascending order.
- Array of size 'n' in descending order.
- Array of size 'n' in random order.

The application will be running through the console.

Note: By default, the size 'n' of the 3 arrays will be 100. That can be adjusted in the Main.cpp file of the project!!!
